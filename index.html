<div class="bio1">
  <p> My name is Sandy Goss. I was born in Austin, Texas and currently live in Guilford, Connecticut.
    I play water polo and am majoring in physics and computer science. I love trying new foods from all cuisines.</p>

<div class="bio2">
    <p> My favorite computer science topics to work on are physical modelling and virtual reality,
      though I am hoping to move more into mobile and web dev by working for DALI lab! I have started working on some
      UI projects I like the control I have over human computer interactions.
      I speak python, java, vhdl, and c# fluently, though most people don't understand me when I say
      "public static void main string args." </p>
