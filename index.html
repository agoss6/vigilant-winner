<div class="bio2">
    <p> My favorite projects to work on are <u>physical modelling</u> and <u>virtual reality</u>,
      though I am hoping to move into <u>mobile dev</u> and <u>web dev</u> by working for DALI lab!
      I like the control I have over human computer interactions when designing UI.
       </p>
       <p>I speak python, java, vhdl, and c# fluently, though most people don't understand me when I say
       "public static void main string args."</p>
